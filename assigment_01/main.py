analysis_text = """
Comparing the age-specific mortality rates for females in the USA and Russia in 2014 reveals a mix of shared patterns and notable contrasts. Both countries exhibit the classic "U-shaped" curve, characterized by high infant mortality, a substantial drop during childhood and early adulthood, and a gradual increase through middle age and beyond. However, Russia consistently reports higher mortality rates than the USA across most age groups.

Russia's markedly higher infant mortality rate (6.69 per 1,000 compared to 5.40 in the USA) and elevated mortality among young adults (ages 15-40) stand out as key differences. This discrepancy widens further for middle-aged women (40-60), potentially reflecting factors such as healthcare access, lifestyle choices, and chronic disease prevalence. In the older population, the gap persists and even expands, with Russian females experiencing a steeper mortality rise from age 70 onward. By age 100 and above, Russia's mortality rate soars, indicating more severe health outcomes for the extremely elderly compared to the USA.

In conclusion, while both countries share overarching trends in age-specific mortality, Russia reports consistently higher rates, particularly among infants, middle-aged individuals, and the elderly, underscoring disparities in health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors between the two nations.

1. Age Standardized Crude Death Rates (ASCDR):
   - Using any standard population, Russia consistently shows higher mortality rates than the US.
   - The difference in ASCDRs is smallest when using Russia's population structure as the standard, 
     suggesting that Russia's age structure partially masks its higher mortality rates.
   - The average population standard provides a balanced comparison, showing Russia's ASCDR is 
     significantly higher than the US.

2. Kitagawa Decomposition:
   - The rate effect explains the majority of the difference in CDRs between Russia and the US.
   - This suggests that the higher mortality rates in Russia across age groups are the primary 
     reason for its higher overall CDR, rather than differences in age structure.
   - The composition effect, while smaller, indicates that differences in age structure also 
     contribute to the CDR difference, but to a lesser extent.
   - The positive composition effect suggests that Russia's age structure actually slightly 
     reduces the CDR difference that would exist based solely on age-specific mortality rates.

Over the course of 57 years (1960-2017), the United States, Germany, and Japan all followed the global pattern of decreasing fertility rates, as evidenced by their Crude Birth Rate (CBR) and General Fertility Rate (GFR) data. However, each nation exhibited unique fertility trends during this time.

While the United States maintained a relatively stable and consistently higher fertility level, Germany and Japan experienced a more rapid decline, particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Notable dips in fertility were observed in Germany, most prominently in the 1970s, followed by a slight rebound post-reunification in the early 1990s. Japan's fertility trend showed more fluctuation due to specific cultural factors. By the 2000s, Germany and Japan had converged at very low fertility rates, with Japan experiencing the lowest rates by 2017.

In summary, despite all three countries experiencing long-term declines in fertility, the United States remained an outlier with consistently higher rates. Conversely, Germany and Japan concluded the period with significantly lower fertility rates, especially Japan, which faced the steepest decline by 2017.

The Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) for females aged 15-19 in Germany, Japan, and the USA from 1960 to 2017 shows a general decline in teenage fertility across all three countries, though the trends vary significantly. The USA consistently exhibits the highest teenage fertility rates, despite a sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, the USA's rates stabilized at a higher level compared to Germany and Japan, likely due to socio-economic disparities and differences in access to sex education and contraception. Germany's teenage fertility rates also decline but display more fluctuations, especially following reunification, reflecting the socio-economic adjustments during that period. In contrast, Japan consistently has the lowest teenage fertility rates, with a gradual, stable decline throughout the period, driven by strong societal norms favoring delayed childbearing, higher education, and career development. Overall, while all three countries experienced reductions in teenage fertility, the USA maintains significantly higher rates than both Germany and Japan, with Japan displaying the most stable and lowest rates throughout the period.
